# Data-Driven-Computer-Science
2nd year Data-Driven Computer Sceince Coursework. "CW1" is the coursework description file, "lsr.py" is my solution and "Report_ddcs.pdf" is my report.

#Coursework Task
The task for this coursework is using linear regression over the set of training data set " datafiles/train_data" to find the model that fits the data. Linear, polynomial and unknown functions are the 3 functions that were used to create the data.

#My Approach
First, I used Least Squares Method for all 3 functions to train the model by finding parameters with Maximum Likelihood equation. Then, I used basic cross- validation method called train-test split to minimise the overfitting. Train-test split also helped me to determine the best order of the polynomial function and the type of unknown function.

#Result
My program can determine the correct order and the model by plotting the fittings except noisy and small data files.
I achieved a mark of 88 in this unit.
